    =============================================================

    Welcome to the Clash Royale Auto-Clicker!
    This program will automatically start playing the game.
    It will be bad, but it will farm your masteries and your crowns
    as playing randomly can sometimes grand you a crown.

    If it's your first time using this program, you will need to
    store a few positions on your screen. You will have some time to
    move your mouse to the required positions and waiting for
    it to be recorded.

    If you have already used this program before, your positions
    are stored in a file named "positions.craf" in the same folder
    as the program. You can delete this file if you want to
    record the positions again. Alternatively, if you use a non-compiled
    version of this program, you can run the 'setup.py' file to
    record the positions again.

    To use this program, you will need to have an android emulator
    up and running, with Clash Royale installed.
    I personally used android studio with a virtual Pixel 4, but
    any emulator should work. Make sure your computer configuration can
    handle the clash royale game with a stable framerate.

    The auto-clicker is configured to have a small delay to avoid being
    flagged as a bot.
    Nonetheless, you should know that using this autoclicker is technically
    cheating and I recommand not using this bot on an account you
    want not to loose.

    To stop the autoclicker, slam your mouse on any of the corners of the
    screen as hard and fast as you can.
